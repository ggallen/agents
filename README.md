# fullsend agents

First-class agents for the [fullsend](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend) platform. These agents automate the software development lifecycle on GitHub — from issue triage through code implementation, review, fix, prioritization, and retrospective analysis.

## Agents

| Agent | Description | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Triage** | Assesses issue sufficiency, searches for duplicates, applies control labels | New issues, `/fs-triage` |
| **Code** | Implements fixes and features following repo conventions | `ready-to-code` label, `/fs-code` |
| **Review** | Dispatches parallel sub-agents across six review dimensions | PR events, `/fs-review` |
| **Fix** | Implements targeted fixes from review feedback | Review comments, `/fs-fix` |
| **Prioritize** | Scores issues using the RICE framework | Schedule, `/fs-prioritize` |
| **Retro** | Analyzes completed workflows and proposes improvements | PR close, `/fs-retro` |

See [`docs/`](docs/) for detailed documentation on each agent.

## Repository structure

```

policies/    Sandbox security policies (filesystem, network, binary restrictions)
env/         Per-agent environment variables
schemas/     JSON Schema for validating agent structured output
scripts/     Pre-scripts (input validation) and post-scripts (GitHub mutations)
skills/      Reusable skill definitions loaded by agents at runtime
plugins/     Sandbox plugins (e.g. gopls LSP for the code agent)
common/      Shared configuration (GCP Vertex AI auth)
```

## Architecture

Agents run inside sandboxed containers with strict filesystem, network, and binary restrictions. Each agent follows a three-phase pipeline:

1. **Pre-script** — runs on the GitHub Actions runner to validate inputs and prepare the environment
2. **Sandbox** — runs the agent with restricted permissions; the agent writes code and produces structured JSON output
3. **Post-script** — runs on the runner with elevated permissions to perform GitHub mutations (pushing branches, creating PRs, posting comments, applying labels)

The agent never has direct write access to the repository. All mutations flow through post-scripts.

## Testing

Run all agent shell script test suites from the repo root:

```bash
make test
```

This is an alias for `make script-test`, which runs the `scripts/*-test.sh` suites. CI also runs `make check-bundle` and executes `make script-test` twice (source and bundled modes) via `.github/workflows/script-test.yml`.

## Script bundling

Harness fetches each runner script as an isolated blob, so post-scripts cannot `source` files from `scripts/lib/` at runtime. Scripts that use shared libraries are maintained as source files and bundled before commit:

| Kind | Path | Edit? |
|------|------|-------|
| Library | `scripts/lib/*.lib.sh` | Yes — functions only, no side effects |
| Source | `scripts/*.src.sh` | Yes — editable script with `source` calls |
| Bundled | `scripts/*.sh` (from `.src.sh`) | No — generated; referenced by harness |

Bundled scripts are self-contained — child harnesses that override `post_script` must provide their own self-contained script or bundling setup. A custom post-script that tries to `source` a base lib at runtime will fail because the harness only fetches the single script blob.

After editing a `.src.sh` or `.lib.sh` file:

```bash
make script-build      # regenerate bundled .sh files
make check-bundle      # verify committed bundles are current
```

Commit source and bundled files together. Test bundled scripts locally with:

```bash
make script-test SCRIPT_TEST_TARGET=bundled
```

Library tests source `.lib.sh` directly. Script tests honor `SCRIPT_TEST_TARGET` (`source` by default, `bundled` in CI's second pass).

To add a new post-script, create `scripts/my-agent.src.sh` with `source` calls to libs under `scripts/lib/`, add it to `BUNDLE_SRCS` in the `Makefile`, run `make script-build`, and commit both `.src.sh` and `.sh` together. To add a new shared library, create `scripts/lib/my-thing.lib.sh` with an include guard (`[[ -n "${MY_THING_SH_LOADED:-}" ]] && return 0`), then `source` it from the relevant `.src.sh` and rebuild.
## Versioning

This repository is versioned in lockstep with [fullsend](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend). Tags are pushed by fullsend's release workflow after a successful release — they are not created here directly. The `v0` floating tag always points to the latest stable (non-prerelease) version.

## Workflows

| File | Managed by | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `fullsend.yaml` | fullsend (centrally managed) | Routes GitHub events to agent dispatch workflows |
| `release.yml` | This repo | Creates GitHub Releases and moves the `v0` tag on version tag push |
| `script-test.yml` | This repo | Runs agent shell script tests on PRs and main branch pushes |
